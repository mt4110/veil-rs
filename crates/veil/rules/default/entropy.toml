# entropy.toml — veil default rules (schema v1)
# Generated seed (builtin migration baseline) — 2025-12-29
#
# Notes:
# - This file is part of the "default" rule pack. Ordering is controlled by
#   00_manifest.toml in this directory.
# - Patterns are regex strings interpreted by the engine (Rust regex).
# - This seed aims to be behavior-identical to the current builtin rules.
#
# Why empty?
# - The current builtin baseline (in this repo snapshot) does not define
#   entropy-based rules as regex Rules. Entropy is typically a separate heuristic
#   engine (thresholds, tokenization, allowlists).
# - So we keep this file as a placeholder to avoid changing behavior.
