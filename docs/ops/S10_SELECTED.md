# S10_SELECTED — Next Epic Selection

## Selected Epic
**PR Ritual Automation (v0.21.x〜v0.25.x Track A/Ritual)**

## Rationale
- **Impact (5/5)**: Directly unblocks the v0.25 intent of the MASTER PLAN.
- **Risk (3/5)**: Tooling focus; does not touch core secrets/scanning logic but changes workflow.
- **Effort (4/5)**: High initial scripted setup required to ensure "STOP-heavy" determinism.
- **Comparability (YES)**: Automating evidence capture ensures baseline consistency across all future PRs.
