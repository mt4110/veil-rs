# Dogfood Operations — Phase 15

## Principles
- Read SUMMARY/ACTIONS weekly and fix **Top1 (max Top3)** only
- Always leave evidence in `docs/dogfood/<WEEK>/FIXLOG.md`
- Maintain the loop: evidence → insight → tiny fix → evidence
- **NOOP is allowed, silence is not**

## Scope
- Docs and configuration level fixes
- No large refactors in Phase 15
