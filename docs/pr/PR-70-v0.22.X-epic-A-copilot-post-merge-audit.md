  - [x] CWD dependency in shell execution (none requiring fix).
  - [x] Accidental tracked temp files (none found).
- [x] Verify main baseline.
- [x] Apply fixes (absolute path removal).
- [x] Verify fixes and regression (prverify: PASS).

## Verification
- [x] `nix run .#prverify` passed.
  - Report: `.local/prverify/prverify_20260213T104023Z_a7695e1.md`
