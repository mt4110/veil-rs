      "body": "## Pull request overview\n\nThis PR introduces a Go implementation of the review bundle CLI tool to replace the legacy bash script, implementing deterministic tar.gz creation with strict security controls and contract verification. The implementation aims to create audit-ready contract artifacts with no host information leakage, enforcing reproducible builds and evidence binding.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Introduces Go CLI tool (`cmd/reviewbundle`) with `create` and `verify` subcommands implementing deterministic bundle generation and contract enforcement\n- Replaces bash implementation with a shim that calls the Go tool, maintaining the same interface\n- Adds comprehensive contract documentation (REVIEW_BUNDLE.md) specifying determinism rules, evidence binding, and manifest requirements\n\n### Reviewed changes\n\nCopilot reviewed 21 out of 21 changed files in this pull request and generated 18 comments.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show a summary per file</summary>\n\n| File | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----------- |\r\n| ops/ci/review_bundle.sh | Shimmed to call Go implementation instead of containing full bash logic |\r\n| mise.toml | Specifies Go 1.24.11 version requirement |\r\n| implementation_plan.md | Fixed file path references from absolute to relative |\r\n| flake.nix | Added reviewbundle package and app configuration for Nix |\r\n| docs/ops/STATUS.md | Updated progress tracking and evidence reference |\r\n| docs/ops/S11-03_TASK.md | Task completion checklist for the implementation |\r\n| docs/ops/S11-03_PLAN.md | Detailed implementation plan and contract specification |\r\n| docs/ops/REVIEW_BUNDLE.md | Contract v1.1 specification with determinism and security rules |\r\n| docs/evidence/prverify/*.md | Three prverify evidence files, two incomplete |\r\n| cmd/reviewbundle/main.go | CLI entry point with command routing |\r\n| cmd/reviewbundle/create.go | Bundle creation with epoch calculation and evidence collection |\r\n| cmd/reviewbundle/verify.go | Streaming verifier with contract enforcement |\r\n| cmd/reviewbundle/verify_test.go | Synthetic bundle tests for contract violations |\r\n| cmd/reviewbundle/determinism_test.go | Byte-identical reproducibility tests |\r\n| cmd/reviewbundle/errors.go | Error code definitions and VError type |\r\n| cmd/reviewbundle/contract.go | Contract JSON parsing and validation |\r\n| cmd/reviewbundle/consts.go | Path constants for contract layout |\r\n| cmd/reviewbundle/checksums.go | SHA256SUMS parsing and manifest verification |\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n💡 <a href=\"/mt4110/veil-rs/new/main/.github/instructions?filename=*.instructions.md\" class=\"Link--inTextBlock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Add Copilot custom instructions</a> for smarter, more guided reviews. <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot\" class=\"Link--inTextBlock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn how to get started</a>."
