The implementation aims to create audit-ready contract artifacts with no host information leakage, enforcing reproducible builds and evidence binding.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Introduces Go CLI tool (`cmd/reviewbundle`) with `create` and `verify` subcommands implementing deterministic bundle generation and contract enforcement\n- Replaces bash implementation with a shim that calls the Go tool, maintaining the same interface\n- Adds comprehensive contract documentation (REVIEW_BUNDLE.md) specifying determinism rules, evidence binding, and manifest requirements\n\n### Reviewed
