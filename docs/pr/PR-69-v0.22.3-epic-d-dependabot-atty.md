# PR-69 (v0.22.3 Epic D) — Dependabot alert remediation: atty

## Context
Dependabot flagged `atty` (unmaintained; Windows unaligned reads).  
`atty` was a **direct dependency** of `veil-cli`.

## Objective
Remove/replace `atty` with minimal, auditable change.

## Change
- Removed `atty` from `crates/veil-cli/Cargo.toml`.
- Updated `Cargo.lock` so `atty` is no longer present in the dependency graph.

## Verification
- `cargo test --workspace` => PASS
- `nix run .#prverify` => PASS
- `cargo tree -i atty` => no matches (atty absent)

## Evidence
- prverify report: `.local/prverify/prverify_20260210T103252Z_d141ec4.md`
