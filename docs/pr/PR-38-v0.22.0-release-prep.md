# SOT — PR #38 (release prep)

## Intent
- Freeze the meaning of v0.22.0: what changed and what invariants are now enforced.

## Change Summary
- Add/update release notes for v0.22.0 in `CHANGELOG.md` (focus: drift-check + SOT enforcement outcomes).

## Invariants kept
- **Merge commit policy**: (Evidence SHA stability)
- **CI artifacts remain fixed**: (Observability points)
- **SOT remains a contract**: (Code changes require SOT)

## Risk
- Low (docs-only). No runtime behavior changes.

## Verification
- `nix run .#prverify` (green)
- Evidence found in `.local/ci/sqlx_cli_install.log`
- `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` enforced in CI.

## Rollback
- Revert PR #38 commit(s) if needed. Tag operations are separate and must be handled explicitly.
